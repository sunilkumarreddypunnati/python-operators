# 🧮 Python Operators Practice

This repository is dedicated to practicing different **Python operators**.  
It includes tasks that demonstrate how to work with arithmetic, assignment, comparison, identity, logical, and membership operators.

Each task is designed to build clarity and confidence in handling operators—essential for writing clean, bug-free Python code.

## ✅ What I Practiced with Operators
- Performing **mathematical operations** on numbers
- Comparing values using **relational operators** 
- Applying **logical operators** to evaluate conditions  
- Updating values step by step with **assignment operators**  
- Understanding how **identity (`is`, `is not`)** works in Python memory  
- Checking **membership in lists** with `in` and `not in`
